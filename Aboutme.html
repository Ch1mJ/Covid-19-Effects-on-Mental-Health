<p>Hello to all, My name is Jada and I am a young woman in the country of Belize. I am currently in school and this is my first website. I created this webiste to spread awareness about Mental Health especially in Belize because I feel like we don't speak about it enough here, this is also the reason I made sure to include how Covid-19 has affected Mental Health in Belize as well. I am a proud Belizean woman who wishes to let everyone in and outside our country know that we are all going through Mental Health issues every day in various ways, so no person is alone! I hope that my research and website can help someone who needs it and I am grateful for any feedback you may leave. Let's be kind to our minds! </p>
